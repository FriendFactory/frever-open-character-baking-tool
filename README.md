# Frever Character Baking Tool

A Unity project for Frever aimed at baking characters to optimize performance by avoiding runtime character building on the client side. This significantly improves loading times and reduces RAM usage.

Characters are baked in two versions using different URP assets to support both low-end and high-end devices. Different shader variants are applied depending on the URP settings.

The baking process can handle characters provided either by the backend or by manually added character IDs. It supports two modes of operation: manual mode, which can be run from the Unity Editor, and batch mode, which can be executed via command line for automated processing on a server machine.

This project runs on the server: it downloads a list of characters to bake, processes and builds asset bundles, then uploads the results back to the server.

## Getting Started

**Requirements:**

- Unity version: `2022.3.28f1`

1. Download and install Unity Editor (with iOS and/or Android build support modules)
2. Clone repository
3. Initialize `git lfs` by running `git lfs install` in the project directory, then pull LFS files with `git lfs pull`
4. Open the project from the Unity Hub or Unity Editor
5. Resolve dependencies

*Note: This project has internal and external dependencies that must be properly configured. Ensure the backend services are up and running before testing the application. The project relies on external services connectivity for full functionality. Some features may not work correctly without proper backend configuration and network access to required external services.*
